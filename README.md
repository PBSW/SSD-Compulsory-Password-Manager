# Project Security Analysis

This document outlines the security considerations, threat model, and limitations of the current implementation. The project is a backend-only solution designed for use through tools like Postman, featuring basic functionality with server-side encryption. Due to its design and implementation choices, the system is best suited for on-premise deployment within a closed network.

## Threat Actors

* External attackers:
  * Targeting misconfigured or exposed endpoints.
  * Attempting to access encrypted data through brute-force or other means.
* Insider threats:
  * Malicious users with access to the system.
* Automated threats:
  * Bots or scripts targeting common endpoints.
* Network eavesdroppers:
  * Intercepting unencrypted communications if TLS is not enforced.

## Threat Scenarios
  * Data breaches: Attackers gaining unauthorized access to encrypted passwords or master keys.
  * Man-in-the-middle attacks: Occurring on open networks if traffic is not encrypted.
  * Misuse of weakly configured systems: Exploiting the lack of secure key management to retrieve sensitive data.

## Security Model
### Backend Security

* Encryption at Rest: Passwords are encrypted server-side, ensuring that data remains secure in the event of database access. Two distinct algorithms are used: one for the master password and another for user-stored passwords. This segmentation minimizes the impact of a compromised encryption scheme for one type of data
* Key Handling Currently, secure key management is not implemented, and keys may be stored in application memory or configuration files. For enhanced security, all encryption keys should eventually be stored and retrieved using a secure key management solution like HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, or Azure Key Vault
* Authentication: Users authenticate using a master password, which is critical for deriving encryption keys. Authentication flow should be reviewed to ensure passwords are not transmitted in plaintext.
* Access Control Access: to the backend must be tightly controlled, with user-specific credentials to segregate data access. Endpoint permissions should be reviewed to ensure role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented, even if minimally.
* Network Security: Deployment on a closed network mitigates many external threats but is not foolproof. Use a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to enforce TLS for all communications, ensuring encryption in transit. Firewall rules should restrict access to the backend to authorized IPs within the closed network.

## Pitfalls and Limitations in Security

* Secure Key Handling: The current implementation lacks secure key management, leaving encryption keys potentially vulnerable in application memory or configuration files. Keys should ideally be rotated periodically, especially in production environments
* Lack of Frontend: While the lack of a frontend reduces the attack surface, it also shifts the responsibility for secure communication entirely onto tools like Postman, which may expose sensitive data during testing.
* TLS and Network Dependency: As the system is designed for closed network use, its reliance on network isolation creates a potential single point of failure. If TLS is not enforced, attackers within the network can intercept communications.
* Static Encryption Schemes: Encrypting all passwords at rest is effective, but static encryption methods may become obsolete over time. There’s no support for algorithm migration, which would allow re-encryption of data with stronger algorithms in the future.
* Brute-force Resistance: Without rate limiting or strong hashing (e.g., Argon2id), brute-force attacks against master passwords or encrypted passwords remain a potential threat.
* Scalability and Auditability: Current design may struggle with scalability in larger environments or multi-user scenarios.
        Lack of audit logs limits traceability of user actions and potential misuse.
